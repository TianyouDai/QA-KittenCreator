# Technologies Used
The demo app is written in vanilla JS, HTML 5 and CSS 3. Client-side Jasmine is used to run the tests.

# Future Development
I would like to have the tests automatically run when a commit is made to the repo, and the site would automatically deploy to production if the tests pass successfully.
